## Development

Code formatting is done by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
Simply format project files by following predefined rules in `.prettierrc.json`:

```
$ npm run pretty
```

which is an alias for:

```
$ npx prettier --write .
```

To exclude files from formatting, please refer to `.prettierignore` (corresponds to `.gitignore`).
